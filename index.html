        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Siang ‚Äî A civil/structural engineering student with limited coding experience. I love history, structures and building. But I want to learn more 
        about the fasinating world of internet and coding, so that is why I have signed up for the DEVSOC's training program.</p>

        <h2>Degree & Interest</h2>
        <p> I enjoyed playing sports, reading about more architecture from time to time. But recently, I have the urge to build something, be it physical 
          or digital. I want to learn to create websites and coding, or just learn to create something overall.</p>

        <h2>Dreams</h2>
        <p>This is a website about dreams, and I have always love and admire the movie "Howls Moving Castle". Its a magical world with steampunk element of 
          giant moving castle.
          
        My dream is to build a moving "castle" as well, or as we engineers called it movable structures.</p>
